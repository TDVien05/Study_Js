1 - JavaScript variable can hold 8 types of data.
  - Include: 
        + 7 primitive data types
        + 1 object data type
    *** The object data type can hold many different object types

2. Data types
2.1 primitive data type
    + Numeric: Number, Bigint
    + Non - Numeric: String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol
2.2 object
    + object
    + Array
    + Function
    + Date
    + RegExp
    + Set
    + Map

*** Note:
    + Undefined: a primitive variable with no assigned value
    + Null: A primitive value representing object absence

*** JavaScript types are dynamic
- JavaScript has a dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.

*** JavaScript object are written with curly braces {}.

*** 
- The strict equality operator (===) for checking NULL value
- typeof null --> return object

*** Diffrence between Undefined and null
- Undefined and null are equal in value but different in type:
    + typeof Undefined --> Undefined
    + typeof null --> object
    + null === Undefined --> false
    + null == Undefined --> true 

*** The Diffrence between "==" and "==="
- "==" loose equality
    + Compare value (automatically casting data type before Compare value)
- "===" Compare both of value and type of
