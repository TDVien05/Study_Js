Use try catch to handle error in JavaScript

1. JavaScript Type Errors
- A Type Error occurs when a value is of the wrong type or an operations is invalid on that type.
- Example: 
    + Anna(5) --> Anna is not a function (TypeError)
    + let num = 1; num.toUpperCase()--> num.toUpperCase is not a function (Type Error)

2. JavaScript Range Errors
- A RangeError occurs when a value is out of its valid range.
- Example: 
    + new Array(-1) --> invalid array length (RangeError) --> RangeError
    + num.toPrecision(500) --> toPrecision() argument must be between 1 and 100 --> RangeError

3. JavaScript URI Errors
- URI (Uniform Resource Identifier Errors)
- An URIError occurs if you use illegal characters in a URI function.
- Example: 
    + decodeURI(%%%) --> URI malformed (URIError)

4. JavaScript Syntax Error
- A Syntax Error occurs when the code violates JavaScript's grammar rules.
- Syntax Error cannot catch by try catch
- Why:
    + The point is how the browser handles syntax errors.
    + The JavaScript engine throws a SyntaxError before running the script.
    + Syntax errors are caught before the try ... catch block executes.
    --> This means the try catch never starts. 

---------------------
JavaScript Silent Errors
- Silent errors are errors that fail without throwing an exception, meaning:
    + No crash
    + No red error in console
    + Code runs but produces wrong or unexpected behavior
    --> These are the hardest bugs to detect
- Example:
    + let x = 1 / 0 --> return infinity, not crash or throw exception
---------------------
JavaScript throws errors
- When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop and generate an error message.
- JavaScript will actually create an Error object with two properties: name and message
- Can throw any data type of JavaScript
- Example: 
    + throw "Throw an exception";
    + throw 500;
---------------------
JavaScript error reference
1. The error object
- JavaScript has a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs.
- It has two properties: name and message.
- There are many "Non - standard properties and method" that mean just many web browser support these properties and method (not all web browser).

Debugging
- Use key word debugger for debugging
