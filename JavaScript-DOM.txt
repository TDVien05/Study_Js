In HTML, each tag in HTML is a node:
    + The entire document is a document node
    + Every HTML element is an element node
    + The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
    + Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated)
    + All comments are comment nodes 
--> With the HTML DOM, all nodes in the node tree can be accessed by JavaSCript
--> New node can be created, and all nodes can be modifired or deleted

1. Node Relationships
- The nodes in the node tree have a hirarachcal relationship to each other
- The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships:
    + In a node tree, the top node is called the root (root node)
    + Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)
    + A node can have a number of children
    + Siblings are nodes with the same parent 

2. Navigating between nodes
- Use these following properties to nagigate nodes with JavaSCript:
    + parentNode
    + childNodes[node_number]
    + firstChild
    + lastChild
    + nextSibling
    + previousSibling 

*** Note:
    --------------------------------------------
    |   <title id="demo">DOM Tutorial</title>   |
    --------------------------------------------
 - We treat 'DOM Tutorial' as a text node not a text attribute in 'demo'
 - So we have many way to access this text node:
    + Use innerHTML --> myTitle = document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML;
    + Using first child and 'nodeValue - property' --> myTitle = document.getElementById('demo').firstChild.nodeValue;
    + Access by node index --> myTitle = document.getElementById('demo').childNodes[0].nodeValue;

DOM Root Nodes 
- There are two special properties that allow access to the full document:
    + document.body - The body of full document
    + document.documentElement - The full document 

*** document.body 
- Represents the <body> element
- Refers only to the content area of the page 
- Contains everything visible to the user:
    + Text
    + Images
    + Buttons
    + Forms
    + Scripts rendered on the page 
- Common uses:
    + Manipulating page content
    + Changing background color
    + Adding event listeners

*** document.documentElement 
- Represents the <html> element (the root of the document)
- Refers to the entire document
- Contains:
    + <head>
    + <body> 
- Common uses:
    + Getting full page dimensions 
    + Handling scrolling
    + Working with CSS variables 

3. The nodeName Property 
- The nodeName property specifies the name of a node:
    + nodeName is read-only 
    + nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name
    + nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name
    + nodeName of a text node is always #text 
    + nodeName of the document node is always #document 

4. The nodeValue Property
- The nodeValue property specifies the value of a node:
    + nodeValue for element nodes is null 
    + nodeValue for text nodes is the text itself 
    + nodeValue for attribute node is the attribute value

5. The nodeType Property
- The nodeType property is read only. It returns the type of a node
