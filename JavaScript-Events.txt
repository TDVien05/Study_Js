HTML events
- HTML events are things that happen to HTML elements
- Example: 
    + An HTML button is clicked
    + A web page has finished loading
    + The mouse moves over an element

1. JavaScript events
- Common HTML events:
    + onchange: An HTML element has been changed
    + onclick: The user clicks an HTML element
    + onmouseover: The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
    + onmouseout: The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    + onkeydown: The user pushes a keyboard key
    + onload: The browser has finished loading page

2. JavaScript event handlers
- An event handler is JavaScript code that runs when an event happens
- Use can use event attributes like onclick are easy to use (but not recommended). Instead of that addEventListener() is recommended.
- Example: 
    <button id="myBtn">Click me</button>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
    const btn = document.getElementById("myBtn");

    // Add EventListener to btn
    btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
    });
    </script>

3. Common mouse events
- click
- dbclick
- mousedown/ mouseup
- mousemove
- ... 

4. Keyboard events
- keydown (key is press down)
- keyup (key is released)
- keypress (deprecated)
--> Developers are advised to use keydown and keyup

*** The keydown event (Using event.key)
    <input id="k" type="text" placeholder="Press a key">

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
    const k = document.getElementById("k");

    // Let k listen for keydown
    k.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
    // Then display the event.key
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "You pressed: " + event.key;
    });
    </script>
- Key properties:
    + event.key: returns the value of the key. Can vary based on language settings
    + event.code: returns the key code. Constant, regardless of language settings
    + Detect modifier keys using properties like event.ctrlKeym event.shiftKey, event.altKey, and event.metaKey to implement key combinations
- To detect enter: using event.code (event.code == 'Enter';)

5. Load event (dont like so I will research later)

6. Timing event
- Timing event let you run code:
    + After a delay
    + Or repeatedly
--> Timing is driven by Timing Event generated by the system clock 
- Timer function:
    + setTimeOut(): Sets a clock timeout (run once)
    + setInterval(): Sets a clock interval (run repeatedly)
    + clearTimeOut(): Clears a timeout
    + clearInterval(): Clears an interval 
--> These methods belong to window object

7. Manage events
- Event management is about adding, removing, and controlling events
